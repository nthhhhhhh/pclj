# pclj/new

A Leiningen template for working with Processing in Clojure.

## Usage

This is MacOS only by default but can be changed to any platform. Simply modify
the directories in the generated `project.clj`.\
Enter this repo and run `lein install`.\
`lein new pclj/new sketch`\
enter sketch directory, `lein run` should get you a sketch window.

### See Also
(https://github.com/quil/quil)[quil] is a polished experience but I found I would rather work directly with Processing.
